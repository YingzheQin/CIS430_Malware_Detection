# CIS430_Malware_Detection


Original csv dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ang3loliveira/malware-analysis-datasets-raw-pe-as-image
If you want to go through all steps including data preprocessing, download the original data above and run 6 scripts sequentially.

HOW TO RUN?

    Unzip 4_percent_image_data.zip and then...
    Option 1: Run 05_train.py locally to train our own model TinyVGG
    Option 2: Run 06_transfer_learning.py on Google Colab to see the experiment results of
              using ResNet121 ResNet161 for 5 epochs and 10 epochs.
    
    You can choose the whole dataset(image_data) created by running the first 4 scripts sequentially,
    or alternatively, start with a small portion(4_percent_image_data).
    By default, we use the 4 percent data. You can modify line 43 and line 48 of 05_train.py,
    and line 13 and line 14 of 06_transfer_learning.py to change it.
    
    When using Google Colab,
    make sure to choose GPU(T4, V100 or A100 depending on whether you have colab pro
    and the load of GPU server on colab). Then you can upload data and python scripts to colab.

    You can either drag and drop the zip file (4_percent_image_data.zip)
    on the file area Google Colab notebook, or upload it on Google Drive and load it to colab notebook.
    For big files, The latter is much faster.

    Please select 06_transfer_learning.py, data_setup.py, engine.py, utils.py and copy them to the file area of colab notebook.
    When data and scripts are all set, use commands below to run 06_transfer_learning.py and see results by using TensorBoard.
    cell 1
        !unzip '4_percent_image_data.zip' # please replace with your data path.
    cell 2
        !python3 06_transfer_learning.py
    cell 3
        %load_ext tensorboard
        %tensorboard --logdir runs
