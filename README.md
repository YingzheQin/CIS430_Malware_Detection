# CIS430_Malware_Detection
HOW TO RUN?
    Option 1: Run 05_train.py locally to train our own model TinyVGG
    Option 2: Run 06_transfer_learning.py on Google Colab to see the experiment results of
              using ResNet121 ResNet161 for 5 epochs and 10 epochs.

    Choose the whole dataset(image_data) or a small portion(4_percent_image_data).
    By default, we use the 4 percent data. you can modify line 43 and line 48 of 05_train.py,
    and line 13 and line 14 to change of 06_transfer_learning to change it.

    When using Google Colab,
    make sure to choose GPU(T4, V100 or A100 depending on whether you have colab pro
    and the GPU server load on colab). Then you can upload data and python scripts to colab.

    You should zip our data(image_data, 4_percent_image_data) for uploading. You can either drag and drop the zip file
    on the file area Google Colab notebook, or upload it on Google Drive and load it to colab notebook.
    The latter is much faster.

    Please select 06_transfer_learning.py, data_setup.py, engine.py, utils.py and copy them to the file area of colab notebook.
    When data and scripts are all set, use commands below to run 06_transfer_learning.py and see results by using TensorBoard.

        !unzip '4_percent_image_data.zip' # please replace with your data path.
    cell 2
